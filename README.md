# Fast Localization and Slow Classification of Mouse Behavior
Prediction using Sparse Video with Trajectory Estimation
Created by Audrey Douglas for University of Michigan CSE 598

# Overview
You can find more about the project at https://audreyadouglas.github.io/mouse_action_rec/

This project does action recognition through a 2 phase anchor method.

###Stage 1

###Stage 2
The VLM being used for this project is Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, but other models can be easily substituted.

# Setup
Qwen-2.5 requires being run on a GPU, so make sure you have the proper resources. On the Great Lakes compute cluster use the packages mamba/py3.10 and ffmpeg.

For all other parts of the pipeline use pip install requirements.txt

# Demo
To try a quick demo with pretrained models, use ----.pynb.
