    <span>I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, advised by Jason Corso in the Cog Lab. I previously received my bachelors in Computation and Cognition from MIT, where I worked with the Info Lab and Fiete Lab. My research interests are generally in computer vision, language, and perception, with my current focus being on video understanding. My interests span temporal reasoning, video representation, multimodal video question answering, and causality. In the past, my work has focused on neurally inspired machine learning architectures and multi-agent behavior understanding.</span>

    <span>Current Research:</span><br>
    <span>My current work focuses on multi-agent long form video understanding for video question answering and outcome prediction with Pre-K classroom education videos. The task involves multimodal representation of the 3d environment, classroom, students, and speech, along with the compaction of video representations. My present aims involve adapting LLMs to reason with these representations and caching information in a person centric way.</span>
